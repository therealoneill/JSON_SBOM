During slow SOCKS5 handshakes, a user provided hostname may not be resolved correctly to an IP address. If the hostname exceeds the allocated size for the target buffer it may cause an overflow as a consequence. This can result in serious confidentiality, integrity or availability impacts through the corruption of memory. **Note:** The vulnerability affects both libcurl and the curl CLI tool. To be vulnerable both curl and libcurl must resolve remote hostnames with SOCKS5. libcurl will use SOCKS5 with remote hostnames if: - `CURLOPT_PROXYTYPE` is set to type `CURLPROXY_SOCKS5_HOSTNAME`, - `CURLOPT_PROXY` or `CURLOPT_PRE_PROXY` is set to use the scheme `socks5h://`, - One of the proxy environment variables is set to use the `socks5h://` scheme. For example `http_proxy`, `HTTPS_PROXY` or `ALL_PROXY`. The curl tool will use SOCKS5 with remote hostnames if: - The `--socks5-hostname` argument is passed, - `--proxy` or `--preproxy` arguments are set to use the scheme `socks5h://`, - One of the proxy environment variables is set to use the `socks5h://` scheme. For example `http_proxy`, `HTTPS_PROXY` or `ALL_PROXY`. Additionally, either the `CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE` option must not be set, or it must be set it smaller than 65541. The curl CLI tool `CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE` default is 100kB, and so it is not vulnerable by default unless the `--limit-rate` flag is used to set a rate of 65541 bytes per second or less. These conditions apply to curl versions **8.X**.
