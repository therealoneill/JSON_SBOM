Such overflows could potentially be abused to lead to serious confidentiality, integrity or availability impacts. **Note**: MiniZip is an unofficial, third party contribution for the zlib library and is thus not fully supported.","affects":[{"ref":"1cf32af0-3dc5-478c-829a-5c0a6f919d91"}]},{"id":"BDSA-2023-3555","source":{"name":"BDSA"},"ratings":[{"source":{"name":"BDSA"},"score":7.4,"severity":"high"}],"description":"SQLite is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds memory access issue due to a lack of sufficient input validation in the `sessionReadRecord()` function.
